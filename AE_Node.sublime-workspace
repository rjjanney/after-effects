Thanks for your support in advance! **\n  =================================================================\n  \n  If you like it, remember to star it ⭐ on GitHub: https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements\n  \n  ** USAGE **\n  ===========\n  \n  See how it works on the Wiki: 👉👉 https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements/wiki 👈👈\n  \n  A little introduction to this plugin could be found in this css-tricks.com article: \"Turn Sublime Text 3 into a JavaScript IDE\"\n  👉👉 https://css-tricks.com/turn-sublime-text-3-into-a-javascript-ide 👈👈\n  \n  \n  *****************************************************************************\n  *                                                                           *\n  *             Do you want to help me develop this plugin?                   *\n  *                                                                           *\n  *                     Become a member of the team!                          *\n  * (see https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements/issues/51) *\n  *                                                                           *\n  *****************************************************************************\n  \n  \n  ** WHAT IS THIS? **\n  ===================\n  \n  This plugin uses Flow (javascript static type checker from Facebook) under the hood.\n  \n  It offers better javascript autocomplete and a lot of features about creating, \n  developing and managing javascript projects, such as:\n  \n  - Cordova projects (run cordova emulate, build, compile, serve, etc. directly from Sublime Text!)\n  - Ionic v1 and v2 (it includes also v3) projects (same as Cordova projects!)\n  - Angular v1 and v2 (it includes also v4 and v5) projects\n  - Vue projects (only about the creation at this moment, see https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements/wiki/Example-Vue.js-project)\n  - React projects (only about the creation at this moment)\n  - React Native projects (only about the creation at this moment. I will add also NativeScript support)\n  - Express projects (only about the creation at this moment)\n  - Yeoman generators\n  - Local bookmarks project\n  - JavaScript real-time errors\n  - Code Refactoring\n  - etc.\n  \n  You could use it also in existing projects (see the Wiki - https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements/wiki/Using-it-with-an-existing-project)!\n  \n  It turns Sublime Text into a JavaScript IDE like!\n  \n  This project is based on my other Sublime Text plugin JavaScript Completions (https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScript-Completions)\n  \n  ** NOTE **\n  If you want use this plugin, you may want uninstall/disable the JavaScript Completions plugin, if installed.\n  \n  ** OS SUPPORTED **\n  ==================\n  \n  👉 Linux (64-bit)\n  👉 Mac OS X \n  👉 Windows (64-bit): released without the use of TerminalView plugin. For each feature (like also creating a project) will be used the cmd.exe shell (so during the creation of a project don't close it until it finishes!). Unfortunately the TerminalView plugin supports only Linux-based OS 😞. See https://github.com/Wramberg/TerminalView/issues/3#issuecomment-390434623, that is a workaround using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).\n  \n  ❗❗ Dependencies ❗❗\n  =======================\n  \n  In order to work properly, this plugin has some dependencies:\n  \n  👉 Sublime Text 3 (build 3124 or newer)\n  👉 Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org or nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm))\n  👉 TerminalView (only for Linux and Mac OS X) sublime text plugin (https://github.com/Wramberg/TerminalView)\n  \n  Not required, but useful for typescript files (Flow wont work on this type of files):\n  \n  👉 TypeScript sublime text plugin (https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin) \n  \n  ** Flow Requirements **\n  =======================\n  \n  It use [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) for type checking and auto-completions.\n  \n  👉 Mac OS X\n  👉 Linux (64-bit)\n  👉 Windows (64-bit)\n  \n  Email me for any questions or doubts about this new project on: pichillilorenzo@gmail.com\n  \n  ** Donation **\n  ==============\n  \n  If this project help you reduce time to develop and also you like it, please support it with a donation 😄👍. Thanks!\n  \n  Open Collective: https://opencollective.com/javascriptenhancements/donate\n  PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/LorenzoPichilli\n  \n  Thanks anyway for your support! 😄😄\n  \n  MIT License\n\n\nConsole Wrap\n------------\n\n  Console Wrap \n  ===============================\n  \n  If you like this plugin, \"Star\" it on ---> https://github.com/unknownuser88/consolewrap <---\n  \n  \n  Summary\n  ===========\n  \n  This plugin helps you easily create (comment, remove, show all) log statements (console.log, print etc.)\n  \n  It places selected variable in log statement like console.log(\"variable\", variable);\n  \n  This is not a snippet. \n  \n  \n  Supported languages\n  =======================\n  \n  * Javascript\n  * Python\n  * Php\n  \n  \n  Usage\n  =============\n  \n  First you need to select a variable (or put cursor on it) and press `\"ctrl+shift+q\"`. The log line will appear on the next line. Press `\"ctrl+shift+q\"` again to change wrapping (info,warn etc.)\n  \n  You can Also remove, comment or remove commented log statements from your selsection or from all document\n  you can find that functionality in context menu (right click) or Command Palette (command+shift+p on OS X, control+shift+p on Linux/Windows).\n  \n  \n  Key Binding\n  ==================\n  \n  The default key binding is `\"ctrl+shift+q\"` and `\"ctrl+shift+alt+q\"` (insert before selection).\n  \n  { \n      \"keys\": [\"ctrl+shift+q\"], \n      \"command\": \"console_wrap\",\n      \"args\": {\"insert_before\": false}\n  },\n  { \n      \"keys\": [\"ctrl+shift+alt+q\"], \n      \"command\": \"console_wrap\",\n      \"args\": {\"insert_before\": true}\n  }\n  \n  \n  \n  Commands\n  ===============\n  \n  {\n      \"caption\": \"Console Wrap: Create logs\",\n      \"command\": \"console_wrap\"\n  }, {\n      \"caption\": \"Console Wrap: Remove logs\",\n      \"command\": \"console_action\",\n      \"args\": {\"action\": \"remove\"}\n  }, {\n      \"caption\": \"Console Wrap: Remove Commented logs\",\n      \"command\": \"console_action\",\n      \"args\": {\"action\": \"remove_commented\"}\n  }, {\n      \"caption\": \"Console Wrap: Comment logs\",\n      \"command\": \"console_action\",\n      \"args\": {\"action\": \"comment\"}\n  }, {\n      \"caption\": \"Console Wrap: Show all logs\",\n      \"command\": \"console_action\",\n      \"args\": {\"action\": \"show_quick_nav\"}\n  }\n  \n  \n  Settings\n  ===============\n  \n  \n  {\n      \"js\": {\n          \"consoleStr\"   : \"{title}, {variable}\", // \"{title}, tmpVal = {variable}\" to assigne value to temporary parameter output: console.log('title', tmpVal = variable);\n          \"consoleFunc\"  : [\"console\", \"log\"],    // You can change default log statement for example [\"logger\", \"info\"] output: logger.info('title', variable);\n          \"single_quotes\": false,                 // If true output: console.log('title', variable);\n          \"semicolon\"    : true,                  // If false, will not add semicolon at end of line\n          \"log_types\"    : [\"log\", \"info\", \"warn\", \"error\"]\n      },\n      \"py\": {\n          \"consoleStr\"   : \"{title}, {variable}\",\n          \"consoleFunc\"  : [\"print\"],\n          \"single_quotes\": false\n      },\n      \"php\": {\n          \"consoleFunc\"  : [\"print_r\"],   // var_dump or if you have custom logger [\"$logger\", \"debug\"] output: $logger->debug($variable);\n          \"preTag\"       : true,          // Put log in pre tag like echo '<pre>'; print_r($variable); echo '</pre>';\n          \"dieAfterLog\"  : false          // echo '<pre>'; print_r($variable); echo '</pre>'; die();\n      },\n      \"fileTypeMap\" : {                   // Maps file type to wrapper.

Place multiple cursors by using CMD+Click or Ctrl+Click, open the [Command Palette](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/command_palette.html) and select _Text Pastry From 1 to X_. That's it! We've just pasted incrementing numbers.\n  \n  Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/duydao/Text-Pastry/wiki/Examples) for examples!\n  \n  ## Features include: ##\n  \n  - Incremental numbers/sequences _(1, 2, 3 or 100, 80, 60)_\n  - Repeatable number ranges _(1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1)_\n  - Generate UUIDS _(ba18f7fc-c387-46da-9544-ed32e49ce6f8 or D306E86C-918F-4551-95A9-CB9865A4DD2F)_\n  - Extendable list of presets _(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or alpha, beta, gamma)_\n  - Extendable list of commands\n  - Create and modify selections\n  - Improved paste _(paste the first three lines of the clipboard data to the three selected locations)_\n  - Generate date and number ranges\n  - Convert to upper/lower case\n  - Duplicate values for pasting _(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4)_ or _(a, a, a, b, b, b, c, c, c)_\n  \n  ## What's new ##\n  - 1.5.1: Bugfix release for Find by regex [#56](https://github.com/duydao/Text-Pastry/issues/56) - Thanks [@timLinscott]\n  - 1.5.0: [New Features!](https://github.com/duydao/Text-Pastry/blob/master/RELEASENOTES.md)\n  - 1.4.10: Scroll into view on search / after find [#33](https://github.com/duydao/Text-Pastry/issues/33) - Thanks again [@miusuncle](https://github.com/miusuncle)\n  - 1.4.9: Bugfix release for uuid x10 [#31](https://github.com/duydao/Text-Pastry/issues/31) - Thanks [@miusuncle](https://github.com/miusuncle)\n  - 1.4.8: Added support for repeating increments [#29](https://github.com/duydao/Text-Pastry/issues/29) - Thanks [@mkruselj](https://github.com/mkruselj)\n  - 1.4.7: Fixed range command (stop condition was ignored)\n  - 1.4.6: Bugfix release for paste by row - Thanks [@Nieralyte](https://github.com/Nieralyte)\n  - 1.4.5: Added the paste by row command (use ```pr``` or ```pbr``` in the command line) [#28](https://github.com/duydao/Text-Pastry/issues/28)\n  - 1.4.4: Bugfix for command ```\\i``` [#27](https://github.com/duydao/Text-Pastry/issues/27) - Thanks [@kcko](https://github.com/Kcko)\n  - 1.4.3: New commands!
